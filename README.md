## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/Getting-Started-with-Mistral.git
cd Getting-Started-with-Mistral
````

### 2. Create environment

We recommend Python 3.9+ and a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Set up API key

Youâ€™ll need a [Mistral API key](https://console.mistral.ai/) for running most notebooks.
Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

(Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook of your choice and start exploring ðŸš€
