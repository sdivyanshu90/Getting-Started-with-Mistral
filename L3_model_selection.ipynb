      "1. **Extract Payment Amounts and Dates**:\n",
      "   - The payment amounts are: 125.5, 89.99, 120.0, 54.3, 210.2.\n",

      "2. **Identify the Two Closest Payment Amounts**:\n",

      "   - The two closest amounts are 120.0 and 125.5 (difference of 5.5).\n",

      "3. **Find the Corresponding Payment Dates**:\n",
      "   - The payment amount 120.0 corresponds to the date \"2021-10-07\".\n",

      "4. **Calculate the Difference in Payment Dates**:\n",
      "   - Convert the dates to a comparable format (e.g., days since a reference date or datetime objects).\n",
      "   - \"2021-10-05\" is 2 days before \"2021-10-07\" (assuming no month-end adjustments are needed).\n",

      "To solve this problem, we need to find two indices in an array such that the corresponding numbers add up to a given target. The solution should efficiently check pairs of numbers without using the same element twice and return the indices of the valid pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "1. **Brute Force Method**: The simplest approach is to check every possible pair of numbers in the array to see if they sum up to the target. This involves nested loops where the outer loop runs from the first element to the second last element, and the inner loop runs from the current element of the outer loop to the end of the array. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), which is inefficient for large arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hash Map (Dictionary) Method**: A more efficient approach involves using a hash map to store the elements of the array as we iterate through them. For each element, we check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hash map. If it does, we return the indices of the current element and its complement. This method runs in O(n) time since each lookup and insertion in the hash map is O(1) on average.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution Code\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def twoSum(nums, target):\n",
      "    num_to_index = {}\n",
      "    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n",
      "        complement = target - num\n",
      "        if complement in num_to_index:\n",
      "            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n",
      "        num_to_index[num] = index\n",
      "    return []\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty dictionary `num_to_index` to store numbers from the array as keys and their indices as values.\n",
      "2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each number in the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.\n",
      "3. **Complement Check**: For each number, we calculate the complement (i.e., the value needed to reach the target when added to the current number). We then check if this complement exists in the dictionary.\n",
      "4. **Return Indices**: If the complement is found in the dictionary, it means we have encountered a number earlier in the array that, when added to the current number, sums to the target. We then return the indices of these two numbers.\n",
      "5. **Store Current Number**: If the complement is not found, we store the current number along with its index in the dictionary for future checks.\n",
      "6. **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks for the solution in linear time, O(n), by leveraging the hash map for constant time lookups and insertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method ensures that we only traverse the list once, making it optimal for large input sizes while correctly handling all edge cases, including those where the same number might be used twice (but not the same element).\n"
